Machine Vision Coding for the SHOOP Senior Design project

This Repository will be split into parts that will be accomplishing these goals(sub goals also listed as they will probably be separate files):

-Identify test strip squares

-Isolate squares

-Find average RGB values for each square

-Find the value that coresponds to those RGB values

-Track before and after data and show on graphs
