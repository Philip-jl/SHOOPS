# SHOOP-MV
Machine Vision Coding for the SHOOP Senior Design project

This Repository will be split into parts that will be accomplishing these goals(sub goals also listed as they will probably be separate files):

-Identify test strip squares
    -Find the outines
    -Properly label each square
-Isolate squares
    -Mask and separate image into respective sections
    -adjust those masks to get rid of color interferences
-Find average RGB values for each square
    -Find average RGB over a large matrix of pixes
-Find the value that coresponds to those RGB values
    -Make a color database for all the pollutants
    -Make a prgogram that checks if scanned RGB values are within range of a value within the database
-Track before and after data and show on graphs
    -find a way to show the polutant ppm found in water onto a graph 
-Show data on a web server
    -Make a website with menus and basic functionality to properly show different data plots
